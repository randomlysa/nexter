# nexter
Example layout with CSS grids

Working example here: http://code.randomlysa.com/nexter/

## How to run
Note the `start` command is super buggy but I haven't figured it out (yet.) It's not good at live reloading, says often it can't find the file. At first I thought it was a problem with my SCSS, but it wasn't. Just keep saving the file (even without changes) until the script "finds the file." Of course if your SCSS does have a problem, it won't work either. 

Really no reason to run this, but if you want to:
- git/clone/download/etc
- cd into the dir
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- open localhost:8080 if it doesn't open for you
- `npm build` to ouput the final css (prefixed, minified, etc)
